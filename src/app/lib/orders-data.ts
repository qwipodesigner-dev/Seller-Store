// Shared orders data — the seed + a tiny store the orders list and
// the order detail page both read from.
//
// Why a shared store? Before this lib, the orders list owned the
// table data and the detail page rendered a single hard-coded
// OrderDetails mock for every order ID. Clicking any row landed
// the seller on the same "QWI-ONDC-260330-8F3K92" detail regardless of
// which row they came from. With this lib:
//
//   - The list reads from `getOrders()`.
//   - The detail page calls `getOrderDetail(orderId)` and renders
//     the right buyer / channel / status for that specific order.
//   - Status writes (confirm / cancel / mark as delivered) call
//     `updateOrderStatus(orderId, status)` and broadcast via a
//     tiny subscribe API so the list page re-renders the new
//     status without needing a reload.
//
// Phase 1 also retired the word "Rejected" — cancelled orders
// now use the consistent status name "Cancelled" across the
// whole module.
